### Tabv for Vim

Easily open relevant groupings of files as a tab in Vim. This plugin is
currently very simplistic and not worth much. I am hoping to develop it over
time.

Currently it supports C++ through `:Tabcxxv` and JavaScript through `:Tabjsv`.
In the future, I hope to make it configurable for multiple languages/project
structures, etc, instead of having these hard-coded. The C++ command will bring
up the header file, the source file, and the unit tests. The JavaScript command
will bring up the script and its unit tests.
