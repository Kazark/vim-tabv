INTRODUCTION                                    *tabv*

Easily open relevant groupings of files in Vim. This plugin is currently
simplistic and hacky. I am developing it slowly over time. If you start using
it please let me know what you need from it by submitting issues on the GitHub
page.

I use it along with *NERDTree* and *CtrlP* in order to easily call up files
from within a project and make working in Vim more like working in an IDE.
Both those plugins are far more mature and powerful than this one is, plus the
guys who wrote them are way better with VimL than I am. I recommend them both
above this one, but they can be used to complement each other.

Currently, C#, C++, Python, JavaScript, and Go projects are all (at least
partially) supported.

COMMANDS                                        *tabv-commands*

                                                *tabv-:Tabv*
:Tabv {name}            Open a new tab with a group of files that have this name
                        as their "root" or "stem" (the exact details of this are
                        dependent on the type of the project). For C++ projects,
                        this will open the source, header and unit tests unless
                        {name} ends in <>, in which case it is considered a
                        "template name" and it does not attempt to open the
                        source file.

                                                *tabv-:Tvword*
:Tvword                 Same as |:Tabv|, but use the word under cursor as
                        {name}.

                                                *tabv-:Vsunittests*
:Vsunittests            Attempt to open the unit tests that correction to the
                        currently open production code file.
